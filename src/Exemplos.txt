Knee Socks
Arctic Monkeys
95 mi

You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world, on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I've got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
'Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter's in full swing and
Your dreams just aren't comin' true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn't approve
Of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold
Of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginnin' of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
Knee socks
Knee socks

Old Yellow Bricks
Arctic Monkeys
25 mi

Old yellow bricks
Love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed
When you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
She was enraged but the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she been dull
Lead to nights readin' beer bottles
You're such a fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
You're at a loss
Just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from
She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia"
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
Dorothy was right though

Crying Lightning
Arctic Monkeys
30 mi

Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called "cold" before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you had left and it was going to waste
Your pastimes, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
"Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
And your pastimes, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
"Crying Lightning"
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying lightning
And your pastimes, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
"Crying Lightning"
Your pastimes, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
"Crying"

R U Mine?
Arctic Monkeys
3,7 mi

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-travelin' diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet mornin' years too late
She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is I need the deep end
Keep imaginin' meetin', wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehavin' for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver linin', climbin' on my desire
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me baby"
"Are you mine?"
She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)

One For the Road
Arctic Monkeys
3 mi

One for the road, ooh-ooh
One for the road, ooh-ooh
From the bottom of your heart, the relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
All the cracks in blackout blinds cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Ooh-ooh, one for the road
Ooh-ooh, one for the road
Ooh-ooh, one for the road
Ooh-ooh, one for the road
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
So we all get back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later, when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

Brian
Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours
She'll be saying, "use me
Show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their
Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator
